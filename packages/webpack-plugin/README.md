# @vextjs/webpack-plugin [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@vextjs/webpack-plugin.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/@vextjs/webpack-plugin)

Integrates the [Venice Unleashed WebUI compiler](https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/modding/custom-ui/#compiling-a-webui-package) into Webpack, formerly known as [VextPack](https://github.com/BF3RM/VextPack)

- Automatically build a WebUI package (`ui.vuic`) after running a WebPack build.
- Support for hot module replacements / hot reloads by generating a proxied UI.

## Installation

With npm

```
npm i -D @vextjs/webpack-plugin
```

With yarn

```
yarn -D @vextjs/webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

By default, this plugin is configured to put the `ui.vuic` file in the parent folder (the root folder of your mod).

We recommend your mod to have the following mod structure:

```
mods/<Your Mod>
|--ext
|  |--Client            Client Lua code
|  |--Server            Server Lua code
|  `--Shared            Shared Lua code
|--WebUI                All your WebUI source code
|  |--src               WebUI code
|  |--package.json      NPM's configuration and dependencies
|  `--webpack.config.js Webpack's configuration
|--mod.json             Mod metadata
`--ui.vuic              Generated by this plugin
```

This plugin can be installed by adding the following to your Webpack configuration

```js
// webpack.config.js
const { VextPackPlugin } = require('@vextjs/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new VextPackPlugin({
      // OPTIONAL: Specify the location where the ui.vuic should be placed, defaults to '../'
      outputPath: '../',

      // OPTIONAL: Make a hot reloadable ui build, this creates a proxy ui that remotely loads the real ui
      hotReloadSupport: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Development
